## Project Description
 > * Why is it important or interesting to you?
 >   * This game will be a great experience for us and will teach us more about collaborating on a real-world project. We are all interested in fantasy RPG games so it will be great to implement our own, and branch out our creativity. Having different types of mythical characters brawling to the death will be a massive hit among fantasy lovers. 
 > * What languages/tools/technologies do you plan to use? (This list may change over the course of the project)
 >   * We will use VS code to write our code and GitHub for version control. Our main language for the backend will be C++. Scrum patterns, user stories.
 > * What will be the input/output of your project?
>   * Menu will ask how many people are playing or single-player mode, and whether or not there will be CPUs playing as well. Users will input their choice of character. Users can see character stats, inventory, and health. Console will output actions and/or damage after turns. As each player is eliminated console will output who defeated who. Console will output the last man standing as the winner. Will input who they want to attack, ally with, or other actions.
 > * What are the features that the project provides?
>   * Single-player mode: User will choose a character, and begin quest to the top of the Fantasy Brawl tower, battling progressively difficult adversaries to win the Fantasy Brawl trophy.
>   * Multiplayer mode: Up to 6 characters will brawl to the death! There can be live players as well as CPUs. Players can form alliances to attack certain players together. Stat changes when alliances are     formed. Last man standing takes home the Fantasy Brawl trophy. 
>   * Each character will have a set of powers, attributes, inventories, weapons, health, attacks, and skills.
>   * Players will roll dice to determine the moves they can make. Will input who they want to attack, or ally with.
 
 > ## Phase III
 > You will need to schedule a check-in for the second scrum meeting with the same reader you had your first scrum meeting with (using Calendly). Your entire team must be present. This meeting will occur on week 8 during lab time.
 
 > BEFORE the meeting you should do the following:
 > * Update your class diagram from Phase II to include any feedback you received from your TA/grader.
 > * Considering the SOLID design principles, reflect back on your class diagram and think about how you can use the SOLID principles to improve your design. You should then update the README.md file by adding the following:
 >   * A new class diagram incorporating your changes after considering the SOLID principles.
 >   * For each update in your class diagram, you must explain in 3-4 sentences:
 >     * What SOLID principle(s) did you apply?
 >     * How did you apply it? i.e. describe the change.
 >     * How did this change help you write better code?
 > * Perform a new sprint plan like you did in Phase II.
 > * You should also make sure that your README file (and Project board) are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project and the most recent class diagram. Previous versions of the README file should still be visible through your commit history.
 
> During the meeting with your reader you will discuss: 
 > * How effective your last sprint was (each member should talk about what they did)
 > * Any tasks that did not get completed last sprint, and how you took them into consideration for this sprint
 > * Any bugs you've identified and created issues for during the sprint. Do you plan on fixing them in the next sprint or are they lower priority?
 > * What tasks you are planning for this next sprint.

 
 > ## Final deliverable
 > All group members will give a demo to the reader during lab time. ou should schedule your demo on Calendly with the same reader who took your second scrum meeting. The reader will check the demo and the project GitHub repository and ask a few questions to all the team members. 
 > Before the demo, you should do the following:
 > * Complete the sections below (i.e. Screenshots, Installation/Usage, Testing)
 > * Plan one more sprint (that you will not necessarily complete before the end of the quarter). Your In-progress and In-testing columns should be empty (you are not doing more work currently) but your TODO column should have a full sprint plan in it as you have done before. This should include any known bugs (there should be some) or new features you would like to add. These should appear as issues/cards on your Project board.
 > * Make sure your README file and Project board are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project (e.g. any changes that you have made during the project such as changes to your class diagram). Previous versions should still be visible through your commit history.

 ## Testing
 > How was your project tested/validated? If you used CI, you should have a "build passing" badge in this README.
